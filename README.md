# Maths-Challenge
Solution to a Maths challenge <br />
This project was written to assist in solving a maths problem where we had to find 4 numbers that added togther at different levels of powers equaled a certain number. <br/>
This project was written in vb.net. <br />
This was 1 of the first projects I ever wrote. <br />
The program is only basic due to it being a first time experince. It was an experiment to get use to the this progamming language.
